# How to Build a Website
## Level 1

1. Go to [github.com](github.com) and create an account. Under “Username” write the name of your organization or the name of the website you will be creating. My example username will be **segregationbeyondlaw** and the address for the site I set up will be [http://segregationbeyondlaw.github.io](http://segregationbeyondlaw.github.io). Fill ”segregationbeyondlaw” with whatever name you desire (this is the name that will be part of your web address).
