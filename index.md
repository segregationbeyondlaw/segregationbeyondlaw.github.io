# Segregation Beyond the Law
## How legal systems failed to reverse residential segregation in Minneapolis, Minnesota

<p><mark>Marked text</mark></p>

In 1948, the United States Supreme Court case _Shelley v. Kraemer_ made racially restrictive covenants in housing deeds unenforceable by state courts. Five years later, the Minnesota Legislature passed Statute 507.18, prohibiting the creation or enforcement of these restrictions. This raises the question: to what extent did _Shelley v. Kraemer_ and Minnesota Statute 507.18 abate the presence, enforcement, and effects of residential segregation against African Americans in Minneapolis? Research on the continued presence of segregation was conducted through the use of data maps from local organizations Mapping Prejudice and Minnesota Compass. Historical and biographical accounts were used to analyze the _de facto_ enforcement of segregation, and data from the Twin Cities Metropolitan Council and US Census Bureau were used to investigate the socioeconomic outcomes.

Despite _Shelley v. Kraemer_ and Minnesota Statute 507.18, residential segregation remained present, enforced, and detrimental for African Americans in Minneapolis. Areas that historically had racially restrictive covenants in property deeds remained widely segregated over the following 70 years. Although racially restrictive covenants became obsolete after _Shelley v. Kraemer_ and Statute 507.18 were passed, other forces, including fear-based social segregation and economic factors such as redlining, remained and continued to prevent integration throughout the Minneapolis area. Because segregation remained enforced, African Americans faced unequal access to wealth and social services and Minneapolis developed the largest racial homeownership gap in the US. There is a clear danger in assuming rulings such as _Shelley v. Kraemer_ and Minnesota Statute 507.18 to be successful measures in terms of ending segregation, when in reality there has been little progress in making a city like Minneapolis an equitable environment for all its residents.
